# Cosmic Cavern

## Mayhem
The manager file consists of a game of Mayhem, a space-themed game where two players navigate a cave/planet/forest while trying to shoot each other down. The ships need to refuel, and avoid hazards such as other planets, bats or birds. Players earn points by shooting opponents and loose some if they perish. The scores and wins of each round are tallied up. May the best space pilot win!

All the images, sounds and other environmental variables are contained in the config file.
This implementation is based from our solution to the third obligatory assignment in INF-1400: Objektorientert Programmering. The addition of start/end/game screen, customisation and music/sound effects (which are currently not working) are done by Tora K. Homme.
